              <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">Today I woke up decently early (yes, 9am is early to me), and got ready for a brunch at home with some family friends. Family friends means that I’m going to get to see my god sisters again who are 7 and 0, respectively. They are the cutest things I have ever seen and I love spending time with them. I haven’t been able to babysit them much recently, because I have been incredibly busy with show choir comps and school, which is unfortunate, because apart from my parents, they are the closest people I have to family in Illinois. Meeting up with family friends is my main method of maintaining a social life in high school, because I don’t have any siblings or family in the area. </p>

              <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">Mondays are always a long and packed day for me, which is rather unfortunate, because it’s right at the beginning of the week. I start my day off with school, as normal, take the bus home around 3:55, and then have two hours of tutoring from 4 to 6. I tutor for an hour, I get tutored for an hour. It’s a pretty good deal, because I get to teach kids and expand my own knowledge. At 6pm I have to get ready to leave the house for Flame rehearsal at the school. At 9pm I leave Glenwood and go back home to eat dinner, do my homework, and sleep. High school brought me a lot of late nights, but two things that always help are adaptability and snacks.              </p>

              <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">Today was the closest instance to a normal day I’ve had in school. I went to all my classes, had a quiz in driver’s ed, and went to Jazz Lab Band after school. Jazz Lab Band is a second-semester extracurricular instrumental group for developing jazz musicians. We have a performance coming up next weekend, and I think it’s going to be great. I got home around 4:30, took a quick nap, ate dinner, did my homework, and studied for my bio quiz.</p>

              <h1 style="font-size:250%">Study Day<br>Wednesday April 16, 2025.</h1>
              <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">Today was just the kind of day where you have no extracurricular activities, but you’re still up til 1am studying. I even got home an hour early, but any amount of time isn’t enough for a bio test. My personal favorite method of studying for bio tests is pretty simple, but unfortunately, incredibly time-consuming. The night before the quiz, I review all my notes and hand-write an outline as though I were preparing a lecture or a worksheet. I use that to review concepts and definitions. I also draw the diagrams out the night before the quiz to help me remember the placement of all the organs in the body systems so that I have an extra day to review them. The night before the test, (so the day I take the quiz), I go home and immediately review all my notes and worksheets. I then finish up all my homework, eat dinner, wind down, and go back to my outline. I fill in all the information I can think of off the top of my head, and go back in later to fill in the gaps. This technique, called assisted blurting, is a form of assisted active recall that really helps me see where I have gaps in my knowledge, prepare for assessments, and have useful study tools for final exams. </p>

              <h1 style="font-size:250%">Show Choir<br>Thursday April 17, 2025.</h1>
              <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">After spending the whole day at school hearing “see you after the break” I felt fully ready for a well-deserved two months off school. Unfortunately, there’s five more weeks til summer. After school I had show choir rehearsal. Since Dessert Theatre is coming up so soon, we had a combined rehearsal with Titan Fever and Titan Flame. When I auditioned for show choir in the summer after eighth grade, I felt absolutely pumped. And I still do; I really enjoy it. As I went to comps and performed, I realized that show choir, while really fun and an incredible experience, was not an extracurricular that’s sustainable for me. While I really enjoyed being out there on stage, a part of me wondered if I could instead audition for the combo next year. So that’s exactly what I’m doing. I think it’s really important to start exploring extracurriculars and finding the things that interest you, because after all, it’s not just your activity for the year, but the next four years. </p>

              <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">The first day of a four day weekend is always incredibly unmotivating for me. I don’t feel like getting out of bed because I have three other days to get all my work done. Instead, I dragged myself out of bed at 11am and made breakfast for myself and my mom who works from home three days a week. After pancakes and fresh fruit, I decided to get all my homework for the weekend done. I read three chapters of 1984, (admittedly one of them was homework from Wednesday that I chose to prioritize sleep over), and completed both my student guided notes for biology and my lecture notes. I did spend most of the day doing nothing, and writing this blog has really enlightened me on how many rest days I actually take every week.</p>

              <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">I dedicated a whole day to sleeping and practicing my auditions, because it’s audition season again!! (It’s also finals season, but I’m in denial.) I’m incredibly excited for jazz auditions as I hope to be in jazz band next year. Preferably along with Jazz Ensemble Mitchell wants everyone to do a concert band next year, but unfortunately I don’t have the space for that in my schedule. Since it’s really late when I decided to write this, I left it short, but I will talk about classes tomorrow, I promise. </p>
