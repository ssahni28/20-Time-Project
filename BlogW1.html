                <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">One of the most important things about high school is the homework. It takes up all my time and leaves me feeling drained. That’s why I leave it for Sunday. Wonderful start to the week, right? My to-do list for the day
                <br>Honors Bio notes
                <br>Read Section 2, Chapter 2 of 1984
                <br>Trigonometry Worksheet
                <br>Study for Driver’s Ed quiz
                <br>I started with the most time consuming one of them all, the Bio notes. I despise sifting through the massive textbook, looking for answers, but I somehow convinced myself to get started. As soon as I finished, I had dinner with my family and went to sleep.

    <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">
        Thank goodness it was a half-day at school today. I had my first tornado drill at Glenwood and I’m glad to say, it is a lot more chill than middle school fire drills. Even though we were only in classes for twenty minutes each, we still ran full rehearsals in both band and choir because regional contests are coming up soon. The afternoon’s agenda consisted of 
        <br>One video for Spanish homework
        <br>Math homework
        <br>Go out to dinner for my dad’s birthday. 
        <br>Something I found interesting about high school is the increased amount of contact post school hours that I have with my classmates. Texting about school assignments, calling for study sessions, and occasionally meeting up at each other’s houses for projects. It’s really nice to have people to talk to who are in your classes and learn the same material every day.

    <h1 style="font-size:250%">Night Before Pre-ACT<br>Tuesday April 8, 2025.</h1>
    <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">Ninth grade feels too early to be taking a pre-ACT test, but at least we get the pre-ACT. I spent the most normal 8 hours at school, and then started reviewing test taking strategies, like elimination, picking a random letter to put for questions I don’t know, and pacing myself. I find another strategy to be really good - looking back at the test as soon as you are done. My evening was rather uneventful; I emptied my chromebook case of everything except pencils, pens, an eraser, my chromebook charger, my calculators (finally I can use my graphing calculator!), and my wireless mouse. I did the little homework I had the motivation to do, and slept early. </p>

    <h1 style="font-weight: lighter; color:black;">I ended up not taking any pictures at all today because I was so inccredibly tired and slept at 7:30pm. Beware, I won't be able to sleep before 10 any other night in this blog.</h1>

    <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">
        The agenda for the day: survive the Pre-ACT, do my best, and go HOME. In the midst of the Pre-ACT, I had entirely forgotten our preview concert for band tonight. The Pre-ACT wasn’t bad at all. I particularly enjoyed the math section, even though I know it’s the most commonly hated subject. I know for sure I’ll have to improve my reading skills, but I have time. I highly recommend having a snack for your mid-test break, and hopefully, a friend in the room. Bringing a wireless mouse was the best thing ever as I personally despise mousepads. The worst part of the test was finishing before everyone else and having to wait for the next section to be opened or for break time. </p>
      <br> I ended my night with a movie, and proceeded to fall asleep halfway through Ursula's death.

    <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">Today was pretty uneventful, but I did have a band concert last night. I didn’t log after my band concert because I was tired and prioritized other homework. It’s really important to prioritize tasks and assignments based on whether it’s a blocked assignment with a specific timeframe and due date or if it is a fluid assignment with less structure. The band concert went well overall, and we are competing our set of songs at IHSA Williamsville tomorrow night. Tomorrow is going to be a hectic day, but thank goodness it is followed up by a weekend. SHOUT OUT ADDI KAPPES AND IYE ADARAMOLA, MY BAND BUDDIES!!!

    <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">
        Today was the busiest single day of school I have had in a long, long time. School went well, and I skipped eighth hour math to travel to Williamsville with the choirs. The bands arrived about 30 minutes after Symphonic Choir’s performance, and Symphonic Band performed almost immediately. As soon as the bands arrived, I spent most of my time with my friend Lillie; a flute player in Symphonic Band. As much as I like being part of friend groups and big tables full of people and conversation, I find it really important to have select friends who you know you can always hang out with, and who would want to hang out with you. All five of Glenwood’s ensembles got division one ratings from all three judges. The Jazz Ensemble was the very last performance of the day, and after 7 hours of being at IHSA, we got home just before 10pm.

    <h1 style="font-size:250%">Preparation for the Week<br>Saturday April 12, 2025.</h1>
    <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">I slept in today, til about 11am, and I can’t say I didn’t need it. I was incredibly exhausted from IHSA, and used today as a rest day to relax and catch up on homework due in the coming days. Along with doing homework that’s due the very next day, I find it very helpful to at least start assignments that are due later in the week so that I’m not rushing or staying up late the night before. The tasks for the day were:
        <br>Work on this 20Time project,
        <br>Study for an English Quiz,
        <br>Read Section 2, Chapter 5 of 1984,
        <br>Fill out my lecture notes in Bio,
        <br>Read a lab for Monday,
        <br>Respiratory System worksheet due Tuesday,
        <br>Driver’s Ed Outline
        <br>Review Packet for Math Quiz
        <br>I hate when homework lists get this long, but I’d rather prep for the week like this, rather than having an extra 20-30 minutes of homework every night. Every minute matters when you’re tired and it’s 11pm and you have school tomorrow.
